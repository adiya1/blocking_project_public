# blocking_project_public
The purpose of this repo is to showcase the data gathering and cleaning our team has done by building a graph that would show a relationship between a few of the variables we have in our dataset. I have observed the proportion of student-athletes in the first-year class and looked at the gender distribution. 
The Rmd file shows my code with comments and the html file shows an overview of our process and a plot.
